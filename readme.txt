Transform your experience with sliders forever. A beautiful, true WYSIWYG interface designed to blend seamlessly with the WordPress core.

== Description ==

**Total Slider** is a plugin for WordPress from Van Patten Media that will transform your experience with sliders forever. Build your own templates in PHP and CSS, then preview the output in a beautiful WYSIWYG interface designed to blend seamlessly with the WordPress core.

= How it works =

Total Slider allows you to create a number of ‘slide groups’. Each slide in the group can be given a title, some description text, a background image and, optionally, a link. You can then have these displayed in a slideshow interface on a portion of your page.

Once this plugin is installed and activated, use the Slider tab in your WordPress dashboard to assemble a group of slides with text, backgrounds and so on. You can then have the slides show up on any page of your site using the Total Slider widget.

Go to **Appearance** > **Widgets** in WordPress and drag a new Total Slider widget to the correct area. Then, simply select the slide group to show in this area of your site.
	
== Installation ==

1. Install Total Slider either by searching for it under **Plugins** > **Add New** in your WordPress site dashboard, or download it here from the Plugin Directory, extract the zip file and upload the **total-slider** directory to **wp-content/plugins**.
2. Activate the plugin on the **Plugins** page of your dashboard.
3. Click **Slider** in the admin menu and get started on your first slide group!
